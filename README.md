# dots-2.0

## An updated, revised version of my dotfiles

I started using eww as a bar so I wrote everything from scratch and took the opportunity tried to be more organized.

Note: Some shell sripts (like the bspwm config file) might include a line like "source <path>, this is supposed to be used as a global colorscheme for all of them, you can delete those lines and set colors manually or use the template called colors.sh at the root of the repo to actually make use of the colorscheme
