# dots-2.0

## An updated, revised version of my dotfiles 

Dotfiles for this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/wosl44/bspwm_decided_to_finally_learn_how_to_use_eww/).

I started using eww as a bar so I wrote everything from scratch and took the opportunity to be more organized. Remember to make scripts in .bscripts and .config/eww/mybar/scripts executable

Note: This configs heavily depend on [wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk). The configs are all set for it to work out of the box, just download it and enjoy having a colorscheme specifically made for your wallpaper! (which you should put in ~/Pictures/Important/wallpaper.png)
