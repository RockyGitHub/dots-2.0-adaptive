# dots-2.0

## An updated, revised version of my dotfiles

I started using eww as a bar so I wrote everything from scratch and took the opportunity to be more organized.

Note: Some shell sripts (like the bspwm config file) might include a line like "source path", this is supposed to be used as a global colorscheme for all of them, you can either delete those lines and set colors manually or use wpgtk https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk with the templates provided in my configs to actually make use of the colorscheme system
